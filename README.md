🚀 Kabadpay –  Smart Scrap.Instant Cash♻️

 Pitched at ICCSAI-2025 Hackathon, Kabadpay is a web-based solution that brings structure and efficiency to the unorganized scrap management sector.

Out of hundreds of ideas, this project advanced to Round 3, and although I didn’t win, the journey was full of innovation, learning, and collaboration. 💡

🛠️ Tech Stack:

 Frontend – HTML, CSS, JavaScript

 Framework – Bootstrap

 Tools – GitHub, VS Code

Kabadpay enables users to track, sell, and manage scrap digitally, encouraging transparency, accountability, and sustainability. This video showcases the frontend prototype built for the hackathon.

Proud of the effort, grateful for the feedback, and excited to keep building. Let’s make tech work for a cleaner planet. 🌍
